Data collection is an important element in the research process that helps a researcher explore the answers to developed research questions. It is the process of gathering and measuring information on variables of interest, in a systematic and structured manner, with the aim of answering research questions, testing hypotheses, or making informed decisions.

Before delving into the specifics of data collection and its contents, it is essential to grasp the fundamental variables that define this process.
