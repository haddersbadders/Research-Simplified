Data collection is an important element in the research process that helps a researcher explore the answers to developed research questions. It is the process of gathering and measuring information on variables of interest, in a systematic and structured manner, with the aim of answering research questions, testing hypotheses, or making informed decisions.

Before delving into the specifics of data collection and its contents, it is essential to grasp the fundamental variables that define this process.

<h2>What is Data?</h2>
<p>Any information, often numerical or qualitative, that has been gathered, seen, produced, or created to support initial research findings is referred to as data. </p>
</div>

Data can be divided into two types that are:

-	**Primary data:** Data collected or created by ourselves
-	**Secondary data:** Data collected by organisations or other researchers for their purposes

## Research Population

A research population constitute a broad group of people or things, with common, defining characteristics, that are the primary subject of a particular study. A population is the total collection of cases that satisfy certain requirements. 

<div class="w3-panel w3-xlarge w3-blue-gray">
A research population means a well-defined collection of individuals or objects known to have similar characteristics.
</div>

For instance, suppose your research aims to delve into the challenges faced by professionals in the healthcare sector during a financial crisis. In this context, the population of interest might include all healthcare professionals registered with the relevant licensing body. This population constitutes the comprehensive group about which you intend to draw inferences. However, despite the ultimate goal of research being to benefit this population, involving every member in the study would be impractical, costly, and time-consuming.

While a census serves as an illustrative example of a whole population study, it's crucial to note that this approach is not always feasible in research endeavours.


Defining and understanding the characteristics of the research population is, therefore, a fundamental step in research design, as it guides the selection of samples, research methods, and the generalizability of findings to the broader population from which the sample is drawn. Accurately defining and describing the research population is essential for ensuring the validity and reliability of research results.

When dealing with the concept of 'population,' two terms often arise: 'target population' and 'accessible population.' 

- The **target population** refers to the entire group of individuals or objects that a researcher aims to generalize and draw conclusions about. 
- In contrast, the **accessible population** is the subset within the researcher's reach, from which they can draw their sample.

For instance, if I'm examining assertiveness skills among nurses in the UK, my target population would be all nurses in the UK, representing the group I intend to generalize my findings to. However, for practical reasons, my accessible population may be limited to nurses working in specific hospitals, such as Doncaster and Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals or a local hospital trust. From this accessible population, I can then draw my sample, which consists of the nurses selected to participate in my study. Now that we talking about sampling, let's move on to this topic and explore more. 

## What is Sampling?

The aim of research is to benefit the entire population, but involving every member is impractical, costly, and time-consuming. This is where sampling becomes crucial. It plays a vital role in project management, especially when recruiting too many participants is impractical. Given the time, money, and resource constraints of research projects, however, researchers must ensure that the sample size and composition align with the study's objectives to support their findings and conclusions.

<div class="w3-panel w3-blue-gray w3-large">
     Sampling is the process of selecting a portion of the population to represent the entire population. A sample, therefore, is a subset of a population selected to participate in a research study. This is a specific group of people that you will collect data from.

The sample is selected to:
-	minimise bias
-	represent the characteristics of the population
-	allow researchers to draw inferences and make generalisations about the population without examining each unit of the population

### Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

After defining your sample, the next step is to consider specific details. Three crucial questions arise:
- 	Who or what constitutes the sample?
- 	How is the sample selected?
- 	How many will be chosen?

To clearly define the population, the researcher establishes inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria determine who is included in the study, while exclusion criteria specify who is excluded. Inclusion criteria identify those relevant to the study, while exclusion criteria account for individuals who might introduce bias or deviate from the typical characteristics of the study groups, potentially introducing extraneous variables. These criteria may involve factors like age, gender, ethnicity, diagnosis, geographical location, or the stage of illness.
For instance, in a research paper on adolescent parents—a 15-year longitudinal study of school-age mothers and their children—every schoolgirl who became pregnant in a specific London Health District between 1980 and 1987 was contacted.

### Types of Sampling

There are two types of sampling methods: **probability** and **non-probability** sampling.

**Probability sampling** is considered stronger. The researcher can precisely specify the probability of each population element being included in the sample, instilling greater confidence in its representativeness. Typically, this method involves random subject selection, enabling robust statistical inferences about the entire group. The technique is employed to minimize the risk of selection bias.

Although more expensive and time-consuming, probability sampling is generally considered superior. It is viewed as a much stronger sampling frame overall. Research textbooks often caution that studies using non-probability sampling frames should be approached with great care.

The common types of probability sampling methods are summarised below:
