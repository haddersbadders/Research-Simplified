A literature review is an organised and comprehensive summary of existing research on a particular topic. The purpose of a literature review is to provide an overview of the existing research on a topic, identify any gaps in the current research, and draw conclusions●	 and implications for future research. It is a critical process that helps synthesise existing research and identify any potential flaws or limitations in the research. A literature review is essential in any research project, as it helps to provide context, identify potential research gaps, and inform the overall research project.

A literature review requires a critical evaluation of the material; this is why it is called a literature review rather than a literature report. It is a process of reviewing the literature, as well as a form of writing.

To illustrate the difference between reporting and reviewing, think about television or film review articles.  These articles include content such as a brief synopsis of the key points of the film or programme plus the critic’s own evaluation.  Similarly, the two main objectives of a literature review are firstly the content covering existing research, theories and evidence, and secondly your own critical evaluation and discussion of this content.

Usually, a literature review forms a section or part of a dissertation, research project or long essay.  However, it can also be set and assessed as a standalone piece of work.

**Definition:**

To Review has been defined as: “To View, inspect, or examine a second time or again”.

It is a crucial stage in the research process to establish what is already known about the topic so that unintentional replication can be avoided.

## Why do we need to write a literature review?

There are several reasons to write a literature review, depending on your research plans. Some reasons include:

- To find out what's already known about your topic. It helps readers understand the background of your study.
- To show readers the size and depth of the topic you're studying.
- To spot gaps in the research, where more study is needed. This helps you refine your research question and focus on a specific part of the topic.
- To explain why your study is important.
- To learn from past studies' methods and approaches, both successful and unsuccessful.
- To analyse and judge the quality and relevance of the studies you're reviewing. This helps you refine your research methods and questions.
- Literature reviews help you create a theoretical framework for your research, giving it a conceptual foundation.
- To avoid doing research that's already been done. This way, you build on existing knowledge instead of repeating it.

## Type of Literature Review

There are various types of literature reviews and these include:

- [Literature review](#literature-reviews-or-narrative-reviews)
- [critical review](#critical-review)
- [scoping review](#scoping-review)
- [systematic review](#systematic-review)
- [meta-analysis](#meta-analysis)
- [meta ethnography](#meta-ethnography)
- [realist review](#realist-review)
- [Review of reviews](#review-of-reviews)

### Literature reviews or narrative reviews

Literature, or narrative, reviews provide an overview of what is known about a particular topic. They evaluate the material, rather than simply restating it, but the methods used to do this are not usually prespecified and they are not described in detail in the review. The search might be comprehensive but it does not aim to be exhaustive. Literature reviews are often topic-based  and can take the form of a discussion. Literature reviews lack precision and replicability and can  present their findings in the context of what has come before. Often, this sort of synthesis does not attempt to control for the author’s own bias. The results or conclusions of a literature review are likely to be presented in a narrative format rather than statistical methods.

### Critical review

A critical review (sometimes called a critique, critical commentary, critical appraisal, critical analysis) is a detailed commentary on and critical evaluation of a text.  The aim of the critical review is to demonstrate that the reviewer has a commanding understanding of the literature to the point where they can extrapolate hypotheses on the topic of review. This type of review goes beyond the level of detailed description of the existing literature.

While conducting a critical review, the reviewer identifies the most significant research in the field and evaluates the literature based on its contribution to the field (as opposed to a formal quality assessment). This review type is usually narrative or conceptual.

### Scoping review

Scoping reviews are exploratory and typically address a broad question, compared to a systematic review that typically has a more targeted question.
Researchers conduct scoping reviews to assess the extent of the available evidence, to organize it into groups and to highlight gaps. If a scoping review finds no studies, this might help researchers to decide that a systematic review is likely to be of limited value and that resources could be better directed elsewhere.
 
### Rapid Review

Rapid reviews aim to produce a rigorous synthesis quickly (due to time constraints/urgency), based on a pre-defined research question. The review process for rapid reviews is the same as for a more traditional systematic review: the emphasis is on a replicable pre-specified search, and screening methods that minimize the risk of bias, although potentially isn’t as stringent as a formal systematic review.
The process operates within pre-specified limits (for example, by restricting searches to articles published during a specific timeframe) and is usually run by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in systematic review methods.
 
### Systematic review

Systematic review attempts to collate all empirical evidence that fit pre-specified eligibility criteria in order to answer a specific clearly formulated research question.  It uses explicit and reproducible systematic methods that are selected with a view to minimising bias, thus providing more reliable findings from which conclusions can be drawn and decisions made.

The process starts with a research question and a protocol or research plan. A review team searches for studies to answer the question using a highly sensitive search strategy. The retrieved studies are then screened for eligibility using pre-specified inclusion and exclusion criteria (this is done by at least two people working independently). Next, the reviewers extract the relevant data and assess the quality of the included studies. Finally, the review team synthesises the extracted study data and presents the results.
 
A systematic review may contain meta-analyses (statistical analysis). A systematic review  which is continually updated, incorporating relevant new evidence as it becomes available is often known as a living systematic review.

### Meta-analysis

A meta-analysis is a systematic approach to combining the results of multiple studies. It is a statistical technique used to combine the results from multiple different studies in order to assess a single overall effect. Meta-analyses can be used to analyse data from randomized controlled trials, observational studies, or both. Meta-analyses are often used to assess the effectiveness of a certain treatment or intervention and can help provide better clarity on the effects of a particular intervention than individual studies alone.
 
### Meta-ethnography

Meta-ethnography is a qualitative research methodology that is used to synthesize multiple qualitative studies. This methodology involves meta-analysis of qualitative data from multiple sources in order to compare, contrast, and integrate the data from the different sources. A meta-ethnography is typically used to look for patterns, relationships, and themes that span the different studies. It can also be used to identify gaps in the research, to highlight areas for further research, and to develop new theories.
 
### Realist review

A realist review is an approach to the synthesis of qualitative and quantitative evidence. It is a type of review that focuses on understanding underlying mechanisms and processes that may explain why an intervention or policy works in certain contexts. The review helps to identify and explain the factors that are responsible for a particular outcome, as well as how different interventions might work in different contexts. Realist reviews can be used to identify strategies that have been successful in similar contexts in order to inform future interventions.
 
### Review of reviews
A review of reviews is a systematic method of systematically summarizing the findings of existing reviews and synthesizing them into a single report. It is a form of evidence synthesis that can help to identify gaps in evidence, identify trends in the literature, and identify areas for further research. The review of reviews allows for a more comprehensive assessment of the existing evidence and can be used to inform future research.

### Umbrella Reviews or Overview of Reviews

An umbrella review is a review of multiple systematic reviews. The process uses explicit and systematic methods to search for, and identify, systematic reviews on related research questions in the same topic area. The purpose of an umbrella review is to synthesize the results of the systematic reviews across important outcomes.
