A literature review is an organised and comprehensive summary of existing research on a particular topic. The purpose of a literature review is to provide an overview of the existing research on a topic, identify any gaps in the current research, and draw conclusions●	 and implications for future research. It is a critical process that helps synthesise existing research and identify any potential flaws or limitations in the research. A literature review is essential in any research project, as it helps to provide context, identify potential research gaps, and inform the overall research project.

A literature review requires a critical evaluation of the material; this is why it is called a literature review rather than a literature report. It is a process of reviewing the literature, as well as a form of writing.

To illustrate the difference between reporting and reviewing, think about television or film review articles.  These articles include content such as a brief synopsis of the key points of the film or programme plus the critic’s own evaluation.  Similarly, the two main objectives of a literature review are firstly the content covering existing research, theories and evidence, and secondly your own critical evaluation and discussion of this content.

Usually, a literature review forms a section or part of a dissertation, research project or long essay.  However, it can also be set and assessed as a standalone piece of work.

**Definition:**

To Review has been defined as: “To View, inspect, or examine a second time or again”.

It is a crucial stage in the research process to establish what is already known about the topic so that unintentional replication can be avoided.

## Why do we need to write a literature review?

There are several reasons to write a literature review, depending on your research plans. Some reasons include:

- To find out what's already known about your topic. It helps readers understand the background of your study.
- To show readers the size and depth of the topic you're studying.
- To spot gaps in the research, where more study is needed. This helps you refine your research question and focus on a specific part of the topic.
- To explain why your study is important.
- To learn from past studies' methods and approaches, both successful and unsuccessful.
- To analyse and judge the quality and relevance of the studies you're reviewing. This helps you refine your research methods and questions.
- Literature reviews help you create a theoretical framework for your research, giving it a conceptual foundation.
- To avoid doing research that's already been done. This way, you build on existing knowledge instead of repeating it.
