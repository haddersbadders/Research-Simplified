## What is Ethics?

<img src="/images/slouchy-couchy.png" class="w3-round" alt="A woman is slouched on a couch watching television. The room is a vivid yellow and full of dirty pans and plates." style="width:100%;max-width:400px; float:left; margin-right: 1em;">
Imagine a person who lives alone in a house. In this setting, they are under no obligation to account for their actions to anyone and enjoy the freedom to do as they please, whether it involves having a late dinner, watching television for extended periods, or even painting the walls a vivid yellow! 

The consequences of their actions are confined solely to themselves. However, if another person, such as a friend or a family member, subsequently joins them in the same dwelling, the dynamics change. The presence of two individuals necessitates the establishment of new behavioural guidelines, as the actions of one person can impact the other. These guidelines, which regulate an individual's behaviour or the manner in which activities are carried out in the presence of others, are collectively referred to as "ethics."

Ethics plays a critical role in various aspects of life, including personal relationships, healthcare, education, and governance. Ethics refers to the moral principles, values, and standards of conduct that guide human behaviour and decision-making. It encompasses a set of rules and principles that help individuals and societies differentiate between right and wrong actions and choices. Ethics provides a framework for evaluating the morality of actions and for making choices that are considered just, fair, and in line with societal norms and values.

## Ethics, human and Healthcare

Human research has a high risk, and even with the greatest of intentions and meticulous preparation and execution, mistakes can still happen. Accidents can occasionally occur as a result of technical faults, insensitivity, carelessness, or disdain for ethics. There have even been a few instances in which research has deliberately and horribly violated human beings.

In recent times, to reduce risk and promote health, the conduct of research in health and social services has become subject to a growing amount of global regulation, requirements, and control.

Healthcare practitioners are required to make well-informed decisions about the best course of therapy and patient care on a daily basis. Research frequently influences these choices, affecting treatment, care, and services. Therefore, it is crucial that we safeguard our patients in all of our decisions and activities. The core principles of ethics in healthcare focuses on - respect of patients, beneficence, justice, utility, and solidarity (WHO - last line title: health ethics)

Ethics in healthcare settings is a crucial and complex field that guides the conduct and decision-making of healthcare professionals, organizations, and patients. It involves a set of principles and values that help ensure the provision of high-quality, patient-centred care while addressing moral dilemmas and ethical challenges. Here are some key aspects of ethics in healthcare settings:

<ul class="w3-ul">
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Patient Autonomy:</strong> Patient autonomy is a fundamental principle of healthcare ethics. It emphasizes the right of patients to make informed decisions about their medical care, including the right to accept or refuse treatment. Healthcare professionals should respect and support a patient's autonomous choices.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Beneficence:</strong> The principle of beneficence requires healthcare providers to act in the best interests of their patients. It involves providing care that maximizes benefits while minimizing harm. Beneficence is closely related to the concept of "do no harm" (non-maleficence).</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Non-Maleficence: </strong>Non-maleficence is the ethical duty to do no harm. Healthcare professionals should avoid actions that may harm patients and should carefully consider the potential risks and benefits of medical interventions.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Justice</strong>: The principle of justice pertains to the fair and equitable distribution of healthcare resources and access to care. It requires healthcare systems to be just and unbiased in their allocation of services and treatments.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Healthcare providers must uphold patient confidentiality. Patients have the right to expect that their medical information will not be disclosed without their consent, except in situations mandated by law or public safety.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Informed Consent:</strong> Informed consent is the process through which patients are provided with comprehensive information about their medical condition, proposed treatments, potential risks and benefits, and alternative options. Patients must give their voluntary and informed consent before any medical procedure.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>End-of-Life Care: </strong>Ethical issues in end-of-life care include decisions about withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining treatment, do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders, advance directives, and physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia. These issues require careful consideration of the patient's wishes, quality of life, and ethical principles.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Resource Allocation: </strong>The allocation of limited healthcare resources, such as organ transplants or critical care during a pandemic, poses ethical challenges. Ethical guidelines and decision-making frameworks help healthcare professionals make difficult choices while considering fairness and patient welfare.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Cultural Competence</strong>: Healthcare professionals should be culturally competent, understanding and respecting the diverse cultural beliefs and values of their patients. Cultural competence ensures that care is provided in a culturally sensitive and respectful manner.</li>
<li aria-level="1"><strong>Professional Codes of Ethics</strong>: Healthcare professionals, such as doctors, nurses, and pharmacists, are bound by their respective codes of ethics, which set forth principles and standards of conduct specific to their professions.</li>
</ul>

## Patient and Public Involvement and Engagement

The ultimate beneficiaries of health care and health service research are patients and the general public, and improving patient outcomes is the primary goal of this field of study. As a result, any type of research must involve both the public and the patient. (Ethics module - paraphrased).

When it comes to research, public involvement refers to work that is done "with" or "by" the public rather than "to," "about," or "for" them. It indicates that patients and other individuals with relevant experience are involved in the planning, execution, and dissemination of research. (NHS Health Research Authority- paraphrased).

Research teams which involve patients and the public run better studies because - they provide a better research experience, are created in a way that participants can accept, contain participant information that participants can understand, and have better results communication to participants at the end of the study.

Patients and the general public can participate in research in a variety of ways, such as by helping to identify the research topic and establish the research agenda, by assisting in the creation of the research proposal, by offering feedback on the proposal, and by participating in advisory groups for studies. In fact, they are able to participate in every step of the research process (R. Module).

## Good Clinical practice

An worldwide standard of ethical and scientific excellence for the planning, carrying out, and documentation of human subjects' research is called Good Clinical Practise, or GCP. The public can be assured that research subjects' rights, safety, and well-being are protected and respected when GCP is followed, as it aligns with the values stated in the Declaration of Helsinki and other globally accepted ethical guidelines. Additionally, it guarantees the accuracy of study data.

The 13 GCP principles are listed below:

<ol class="w3-ul w3-card-4">
<li class="w3-bar"><img src="/images/scales.png" class="w3-bar-item w3-circle" style="width:85px" alt="scales">
<strong>Ethics:</strong> Clinical trials should be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, and that are consistent with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirement(s).</li>
<li class="w3-bar"><img src="/images/risk.png" class="w3-bar-item w3-circle" style="width:85px" alt="graph"><strong>Trial risk vs. trial benefit: </strong>Before a trial is initiated, foreseeable risks and inconveniences should be weighed against the anticipated benefit for the individual trial subject and society. A trial should be initiated and continued only if the anticipated benefits justify the risks.</li>
<li class="w3-bar"><strong>Trial participants: </strong>The rights, safety, and well-being of the trial subjects are the most important considerations and should prevail over the interests of science and society.</li>
<li class="w3-bar"><strong>Information on medicinal products:</strong> The available nonclinical and clinical information on an investigational product should be adequate to support the proposed clinical trial.</li>
<li class="w3-bar"><strong>Good quality trials:</strong> Clinical trials should be scientifically sound, and described in a clear, detailed protocol.</li>
<li class="w3-bar"><strong>Compliance with the study protocol:</strong> A trial should be conducted in compliance with the protocol that has received prior institutional review board (IRB)/independent ethics committee (IEC) approval/favourable opinion.</li>
<li class="w3-bar"><strong>Medicinal decisions:</strong> The medical care given to, and medical decisions made on behalf of, subjects should always be the responsibility of a qualified physician or, when appropriate, of a qualified dentist.</li>
<li class="w3-bar"><strong>Trial staff:</strong> Each individual involved in conducting a trial should be qualified by education, training, and experience to perform his or her respective task(s).</li>
<li class="w3-bar"><strong>Informed consent:</strong> Freely given informed consent should be obtained from every subject prior to clinical trial participation.</li>
<li class="w3-bar">&nbsp;<strong>Clinical trial data:</strong> All clinical trial information should be recorded, handled, and stored in a way that allows its accurate reporting, interpretation and verification.</li>
<li class="w3-bar"><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> The confidentiality of records that could identify subjects should be protected, respecting the privacy and confidentiality rules in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirement(s).</li>
<li class="w3-bar"><strong>Good manufacturing practice:</strong> Investigational products should be manufactured, handled, and stored in accordance with applicable good manufacturing practice (GMP). They should be used in accordance with the approved protocol.</li>
<li class="w3-bar"><strong>Quality assurance:</strong> Systems with procedures that assure the quality of every aspect of the trial should be implemented.</li>
