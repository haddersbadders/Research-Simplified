Can you envision navigating through the streets of London without a map or navigator? Most likely, you cannot. In the same vein, conducting research without a well-thought-out research design would be both challenging and inevitable. If research is to be meaningful and beneficial, meticulous planning is essential. This planning process, and the resulting 'blueprint,' is referred to as the research design. In the realm of research, the research design serves as a guiding map that researchers follow to achieve their research aims and objectives.

## Purpose of Research Design

Some of the key purposes of research design are:

- To provide a structure for answering a specific research question
- To aid in the solution of the research question and to maintain control
- The research design involves designs for the following aspects of the study:
  - What will be research aims and objectives?
  - How to integrate theoretical and methodological approaches to it?
  - What will be the research participants, settings and location?
  - Will there be an intervention?
  - What type of comparison will be made?
  - what procedures will be used to control extraneous variables?
  - When and how many times will data be collected from research subjects?
  - In what settings will the study take place?
  - When will the research project be completed (timeline)?

## Developing Research Design
The issues around the concept of research design are crucial, as they determine the nature of a piece of research. The research design must be determined at the beginning of the research process as it then sets the scene for the work that will be undertaken by the researcher.

## Types of Research Design

Different research designs are used by researchers that help them answer their research problems.  However, broadly at a higher level, there are two major approaches/designs to research: qualitative and quantitative.

## Qualitative Research

Qualitative research involves collecting and analysing data to gain an understanding of individuals' social reality, including understanding their attitudes, beliefs and motivations. 

Qualitative researchers engage with study participants in their natural social settings to gain a holistic picture of their life experiences. Qualitative researchers may be required to engage over some time with research settings to familiarise themselves with social, cultural and other contextual variables and to build rapport with research participants. We will discuss the need for prolonged engagement in quantitative research later in the book. 

Qualitative research is a valuable approach to understanding the complexities of human behaviour, experiences, and social phenomena. However, like any research method, it comes with its own set of advantages and disadvantages:

In summary, qualitative research is a powerful tool for exploring complex, context-dependent phenomena and understanding the lived experiences of individuals. However, it has limitations, including subjectivity, limited generalizability, and the resource-intensive nature of data collection and analysis. Researchers should carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages of qualitative research when choosing their research approach.

### Types of Qualitative Research

Qualitative research encompasses a wide range of methodologies and approaches designed to explore and understand human experiences, behaviours, and social phenomena. Here are some common types of qualitative research used in nursing and health:

- **Phenomenology**: Focuses on exploring the lived experiences of individuals, often patients or healthcare providers, to understand the essence of a particular phenomenon or condition.

- **Grounded Theory Research**: Aims to develop theories or models grounded in data, typically used to explore and explain social processes and interactions within healthcare contexts.

- **Ethnographic Research**: Involves deep immersion in a particular healthcare culture, such as a hospital or clinic, to understand the behaviours, practices, and values of healthcare professionals and patients.

- **Case Study Research**: Examines a specific case or instance within healthcare, providing an in-depth analysis of a particular situation or intervention.

- **Narrative Research**: Involves the collection and analysis of personal stories, narratives, or accounts related to healthcare experiences to understand patient perspectives.

- **Action Research**: Integrates research with practical action to address specific healthcare problems or challenges, often in a collaborative manner with healthcare professionals.

Researchers can select the method that best aligns with their research questions and goals to gain deeper insights into the issues relevant to the field of nursing and healthcare. Below we describe three main types in further detail.
