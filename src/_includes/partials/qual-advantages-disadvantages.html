      <td>Qualitative research generates in-depth, rich, and detailed data that can provide a nuanced understanding of a subject or phenomenon</td>
      <td>Qualitative research is inherently subjective, as it relies on the interpretation of researchers. Bias can be introduced during data collection and analysis. </td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>It is well-suited for exploring new topics, generating hypotheses, or investigating complex, little-understood issues.</td>
        <td>The small, non-random samples in qualitative studies may limit the generalizability of findings to broader populations</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>Qualitative research allows researchers to gather insights within the context in which the behavior or phenomenon occurs, providing a deeper understanding of the environment.</td>
        <td>Qualitative research is often more time-consuming and resource-intensive than quantitative methods due to data collection, transcription, and in-depth analysis.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>Researchers have flexibility in data collection methods, allowing them to adapt to evolving research questions or unexpected insights during the study.</td>
    <td>Qualitative research is often more time-consuming and resource-intensive than quantitative methods due to data collection, transcription, and in-depth analysis.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>This approach emphasises the participants' perspectives, giving a voice to the people being studied and allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of their experiences.</td>
    <td>Analyzing qualitative data can be complex and labour-intensive, as it often involves coding, categorizing, and synthesizing large amounts of text.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Qualitative research can capture the full complexity of a situation by examining multiple variables, interactions, and contributing factors.</td>
        <td>Replicating qualitative research can be challenging, as it is challenging to capture the same context and nuances in different settings.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr><td>The findings can inform practical applications, such as program development, policy changes, and improved healthcare practices.</td>
    <td>Ensuring the privacy and confidentiality of participants can be challenging, especially in sensitive or controversial topics.</td></tr>
