  <h1>An Introduction to Research</h1>
</header>
    <p>Research supports practitioners in providing the best possible and most effective care to the people they serve. Available evidence suggests that research-active healthcare organisations have lower mortality rates, increased treatment options and better patient satisfaction than those that are not.  This chapter aims to provide an introduction to research, the research process and the importance of research. it will also provide an overview of the subsequent chapters.</p>
<div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-sand">
<p class="w3-large">Research refers to the systematic exploration of issues to understand complexities and find practical solutions. It aims to develop generalizable or transferable new knowledge with the goal of improving practices"</p>
(National Institute for Health and Care Research, 2022).
</div>
<p>Research is a carefully planned and systematic process. It's like exploring uncharted territory to discover new things and find better ways of doing things. In simple terms, research helps us figure out complex issues and come up with practical solutions. The goal is to create knowledge that can be used to improve how things are done, especially in healthcare.</p>
<p>Research is a bit like detective work. It's about investigating problems, looking for clues, and finding answers. When healthcare professionals, like nurses and midwives, do research, they're trying to make sure they're doing the best job they can for their patients. Imagine it's like having a treasure map that guides you to provide the best care possible.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we'll dive into the world of research. We'll explore why research is important, how it helps us make healthcare better, and what the research process looks like. By the end of this chapter, you'll have a clearer picture of what research is all about, and you'll be ready to journey further into the world of healthcare research.</p>
<h2>Why should we be involved in Research?</h2>
<p>Nurses, midwives, and other healthcare professionals are responsible for giving high-quality care to their patients. Research helps us do just that. It's like having a toolbox full of tools that make our job easier and better.</p>
<p>Here's why being involved in research is so important:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Evidence-Based Care:</strong> Research gives us the evidence we need to make informed decisions about how to care for patients. It's like having a reliable guide that tells us what works best.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cost-Effective Care:</strong> Research helps us use our resources wisely. It's like making sure we have the right ingredients for a recipe, so we don't waste anything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Safety and Quality:</strong> Research helps us make healthcare safer and better. It's like having a safety net to catch any problems before they happen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Innovation and Technology:</strong> Research drives innovation and new technology. It's like getting the latest and greatest tools to do our job.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Patient Experience and Outcomes:</strong> Research ensures that patients have the best possible experience and outcomes. It's like making sure every journey ends with a smile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Knowledge and Skills:</strong> Research helps us grow and learn. It's like having a library of books that we can keep adding to.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Research process</h2>
<p>Think of the research process as a roadmap. It's like having a step-by-step guide to help us navigate through the research journey. In reality, it's not always a straight line; sometimes, we go in circles or take detours. But having a roadmap helps us stay on track.
<img src="/assets/img/research-process.jpg" alt="The Research Process"></p>
<p>This website is designed to be your trusty guide on this research journey. It's meant for healthcare professionals working in different settings, and it covers a wide range of topics, from asking research questions to finding answers.</p>
<p>By the end of this website, you'll have a good grasp of what research is, why it's essential, and how you can be a part of it. We'll use the research process as our compass to explore each aspect of research more deeply. Our goal is to make research less daunting and more accessible, so you can use it to provide top-notch care to your patients and contribute to the world of healthcare knowledge. Let's embark on this research adventure together.</p>
<p>We will use the research process as mentioned above, as a guide to delve deeper into each aspect. Ultimately, this website is envisioned as a valuable tool to empower nurses/healthcare professionals, irrespective of their experience or specialisation, to harness the power of research to provide the highest quality care to their patients and contribute to the ongoing advancement of the nursing/their profession. By demystifying research and offering practical guidance, it seeks to inspire nurses to become confident and proficient consumers and contributors to the ever-evolving body of nursing knowledge.</p>
