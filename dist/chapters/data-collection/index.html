  <h1>Data Collection</h1>
</header>
<main>
    <p>Data collection is an important element in the research process that helps a researcher explore the answers to developed research questions. It is the process of gathering and measuring information on variables of interest, in a systematic and structured manner, with the aim of answering research questions, testing hypotheses, or making informed decisions.</p>
<p>Before delving into the specifics of data collection and its contents, it is essential to grasp the fundamental variables that define this process.</p>
<div class="w3-panel w3-teal">
<h2>What is Data?</h2>
<p>Any information, often numerical or qualitative, that has been gathered, seen, produced, or created to support initial research findings is referred to as data. </p>
</div>
<p>Data can be divided into two types that are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary data:</strong> Data collected or created by ourselves</li>
<li><strong>Secondary data:</strong> Data collected by organisations or other researchers for their purposes</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="research-population" tabindex="-1">Research Population</h2>
<img src="/images/population-sample.png" alt="diagram showing how the research sample is much smaller than the target population" >
<p>A research population constitute a broad group of people or things, with common, defining characteristics, that are the primary subject of a particular study. A population is the total collection of cases that satisfy certain requirements.</p>
<div class="w3-panel w3-xlarge w3-blue-gray">
A research population means a well-defined collection of individuals or objects known to have similar characteristics.
</div>
<p>For instance, suppose your research aims to delve into the challenges faced by professionals in the healthcare sector during a financial crisis. In this context, the population of interest might include all healthcare professionals registered with the relevant licensing body. This population constitutes the comprehensive group about which you intend to draw inferences. However, despite the ultimate goal of research being to benefit this population, involving every member in the study would be impractical, costly, and time-consuming.</p>
<p>While a census serves as an illustrative example of a whole population study, it's crucial to note that this approach is not always feasible in research endeavours.</p>
<p>Defining and understanding the characteristics of the research population is, therefore, a fundamental step in research design, as it guides the selection of samples, research methods, and the generalizability of findings to the broader population from which the sample is drawn. Accurately defining and describing the research population is essential for ensuring the validity and reliability of research results.</p>
<p>When dealing with the concept of 'population,' two terms often arise: 'target population' and 'accessible population.'</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>target population</strong> refers to the entire group of individuals or objects that a researcher aims to generalize and draw conclusions about.</li>
<li>In contrast, the <strong>accessible population</strong> is the subset within the researcher's reach, from which they can draw their sample.</li>
</ul>
<p>For instance, if I'm examining assertiveness skills among nurses in the UK, my target population would be all nurses in the UK, representing the group I intend to generalize my findings to. However, for practical reasons, my accessible population may be limited to nurses working in specific hospitals, such as Doncaster and Bassetlaw Teaching Hospitals or a local hospital trust. From this accessible population, I can then draw my sample, which consists of the nurses selected to participate in my study. Now that we talking about sampling, let's move on to this topic and explore more.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-sampling%3F" tabindex="-1">What is Sampling?</h2>
<p>The aim of research is to benefit the entire population, but involving every member is impractical, costly, and time-consuming. This is where sampling becomes crucial. It plays a vital role in project management, especially when recruiting too many participants is impractical. Given the time, money, and resource constraints of research projects, however, researchers must ensure that the sample size and composition align with the study's objectives to support their findings and conclusions.</p>
<div class="w3-panel w3-blue-gray w3-large w3-padding">
     Sampling is the process of selecting a portion of the population to represent the entire population. A sample, therefore, is a subset of a population selected to participate in a research study. This is a specific group of people that you will collect data from. 
     </div>
<p>The sample is selected to:</p>
<ul>
<li>minimise bias</li>
<li>represent the characteristics of the population</li>
<li>allow researchers to draw inferences and make generalisations about the population without examining each unit of the population</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="inclusion-and-exclusion-criteria" tabindex="-1">Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria</h3>
<p>After defining your sample, the next step is to consider specific details. Three crucial questions arise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who or what constitutes the sample?</li>
<li>How is the sample selected?</li>
<li>How many will be chosen?</li>
</ul>
<p>To clearly define the population, the researcher establishes inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria determine who is included in the study, while exclusion criteria specify who is excluded. Inclusion criteria identify those relevant to the study, while exclusion criteria account for individuals who might introduce bias or deviate from the typical characteristics of the study groups, potentially introducing extraneous variables. These criteria may involve factors like age, gender, ethnicity, diagnosis, geographical location, or the stage of illness.
For instance, in a research paper on adolescent parents—a 15-year longitudinal study of school-age mothers and their children—every schoolgirl who became pregnant in a specific London Health District between 1980 and 1987 was contacted.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-sampling" tabindex="-1">Types of Sampling</h3>
<p>There are two types of sampling methods: <strong>probability</strong> and <strong>non-probability</strong> sampling.</p>
<p><strong>Probability sampling</strong> is considered stronger. The researcher can precisely specify the probability of each population element being included in the sample, instilling greater confidence in its representativeness. Typically, this method involves random subject selection, enabling robust statistical inferences about the entire group. The technique is employed to minimize the risk of selection bias.</p>
<p>Although more expensive and time-consuming, probability sampling is generally considered superior. It is viewed as a much stronger sampling frame overall. Research textbooks often caution that studies using non-probability sampling frames should be approached with great care.</p>
<p>The common types of probability sampling methods are summarised below:</p>
<h1>((Tables to go here))</h1>
<p><strong>Non-probability sampling</strong> is employed when achieving a probability-based sample is not feasible. However, it is crucial for the researcher and reader to ensure that the sample avoids bias in representing specific population segments disproportionately. In this type of sampling, not every subject has an equal chance of being included in the sample.</p>
<p>Qualitative research often utilizes non-probability sampling, and in this context, a smaller sample size is considered a strength rather than a weakness. It's important to note that non-probability sampling is also used in quantitative research, though it is generally viewed as less favorable than probability sampling methods. The following outlines non-probability/qualitative sampling techniques:</p>
<h1>((Tables to go here))</h1>
<h3 id="sample-size" tabindex="-1">Sample Size</h3>
<p>Determining the appropriate sample size is a crucial step in research, and various factors influence this decision. There is no one-size-fits-all rule for establishing sample size, but several considerations come into play:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type of Design</strong>: The nature of the research design impacts the required sample size.
<ul>
<li><strong>Sampling Procedures</strong>: The method used for sampling plays a role in determining the sample size.</li>
<li><strong>Formula for Estimation</strong>: The specific formula employed to estimate the optimal sample size is a key factor.</li>
<li><strong>Precision Requirement</strong>: The desired degree of precision in the study influences sample size.</li>
<li><strong>Heterogeneity of Attributes</strong>: The diversity of characteristics being investigated affects sample size determination.</li>
<li><strong>Frequency of Phenomenon Occurrence</strong>: Whether the phenomenon is common or rare in the population is a significant consideration.</li>
<li><strong>Project Cost</strong>: The financial implications of employing a particular sampling strategy need to be considered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is advisable to determine the sample size before commencing the study, and a general guideline is to aim for the largest sample feasible. Larger samples tend to be more representative of the population, enhancing the reliability of results. Conversely, smaller samples may yield less accurate findings.
In quantitative research, larger sample sizes are typically used compared to qualitative research. Quantitative researchers often employ a statistical procedure called power analysis to estimate the appropriate sample size. For further understanding, a paper by Eng (2003) in the field of radiology provides insights into sample size calculation in quantitative research.</p>
<p><a href="Eng, J. (2003). Sample Size Estimation: How Many Individuals Should Be Studied? 1. Radiology, 227(2), 309-313 " target="_blank">Eng, J. (2003). Sample Size Estimation: How Many Individuals Should Be Studied? 1. Radiology, 227(2), 309-313 </a> <strong>NEEDS TO BE ON LIBRARY</strong></p>
<p>In qualitative research, sample size is not predetermined. Due to the extensive analysis of verbal data and the emphasis on intensive participant contact, qualitative research often involves small sample sizes. Participants are added until data saturation is achieved, indicating that no new data emerges during the collection process. Mason's paper (2010) on sample size and saturation in qualitative interviews provides valuable insights into determining appropriate sample sizes in qualitative research.</p>
<p><a href="#" target="_blank">Mason, M. (2010, August). Sample size and saturation in PhD studies using qualitative interviews. In Forum Qualitative Sozialforschung/Forum: Qualitative Social Research (Vol. 11, No. 3)</a> <strong>NEEDS TO BE ON LIBRARY</strong></p>
<p>Additionally, guidelines for various qualitative approaches can be found in the accompanying table.</p>

<h4 id="research-participant" tabindex="-1">Research Participant</h4>
<p>A research participant, also known as a human subject, experimentee, trial participant, study participant, or subject, is an individual who willingly takes part in human subject research after providing informed consent to be the subject of the study. A research participant is often a volunteer who consents to participate in the research on equal terms.</p>
<h4 id="identification-and-recruitment-of-participants" tabindex="-1">Identification and Recruitment of Participants</h4>
<p>Identification and recruitment of appropriate participants to the research study can be a big challenge for the researcher. Recruitment refers to a dialogue that takes place between a researcher and a potential participant prior to the initiation of the consent process. It begins with the identification, targeting and enlistment of participants (volunteer patients or controls) for a research study. It involves providing information to the potential participants and generating their interest in the proposed study. There are two main goals of recruitment:</p>
<ul>
<li>To recruit a sample that adequately represents the target population</li>
<li>To recruit sufficient participants to meet the sample size and power requirements of the study</li>
</ul>
<div class="w3-panel w3-blue-gray w3-large w3-padding">
<h4>Data collection</h4>
<p>Data collection refers to refers to the process of collecting or gathering data about a particular research question.</p>
</div>
<p>Any data collection method should have some basic characteristics and these may include attention to some points as described below.</p>

    </tr>
    </table>
<p>Data collection methods are often dependent on research questions and methodological approaches i.e., qualitative and quantitative research. Researchers can employ a single or a number of data collection methods to collect information.</p>
<p>Both qualitative and quantitative researchers use a combination of methods of data collection.</p>
<p>The main data collection methods used by healthcare researchers include the following:</p>
<img src="/images/MethodsDataCollection.jpg" alt="methods of data collection:Questionnaire, Scales, Physiological Measures, Interviews, Focus Group Discussion and Observation" />
<h3 id="questionnaire" tabindex="-1">Questionnaire</h3>
<p>Data collection via questionnaires involves a variety of instruments falling under the umbrella term &quot;questionnaire.&quot; These instruments can take different forms, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Closed responses</li>
<li>Open responses</li>
<li>Checklists</li>
<li>Rating scales</li>
<li>Open-ended comments</li>
</ul>
<p>Questionnaires are designed to be both standardized and structured. In quantitative research, they serve various purposes, with a common application in descriptive studies, especially surveys. This is because questionnaires efficiently collect a broad range of information on facts, beliefs, attitudes, and experiences from numerous participants in a relatively quick and cost-effective manner. Questionnaires can consist of a single question type or a combination of different methods, categorized as either:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Self-reported</strong>: Completed by the participant without the researcher's presence.</li>
<li><strong>Researcher-assisted</strong>: The researcher employs the questionnaire to interview the participant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite their seemingly straightforward nature, crafting a questionnaire requires careful consideration. Elements such as selecting question types, formulating questions, structuring the questionnaire, conducting pilot tests, and managing distribution and collection/return processes demand attention to ensure the reliability and validity of the collected data.</p>
<h4 id="general-principles-of-questionnaires" tabindex="-1">General Principles of Questionnaires</h4>
<p>The fundamental principles of questionnaires encompass several key aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Primary Aim</strong>: The primary goal is effective communication with the participant.</li>
<li><strong>Question Clarity</strong>: Questions must be understandable and structured appropriately to facilitate responses.</li>
<li><strong>Language Importance</strong>: Language plays a central role in framing questions to elicit expected responses, known as the 'frame of reference' or context.</li>
<li><strong>Information Level</strong>: The language should align with participants' comprehension levels. Considerations include literacy, ethnic and cultural backgrounds, age, and participants' understanding. Special care is needed when addressing sensitive topics, such as sexuality or abuse, and the use of technical language requires caution. The language should avoid being overly simplistic, patronizing, or utilizing confusing, embarrassing, or upsetting terms.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="questionnaire-design" tabindex="-1">Questionnaire Design</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Investigation Scope</strong>: The design should delve into the minimum amount of a person's experience necessary to answer the research question.</li>
<li><strong>Information Collection</strong>: It should collect only essential information, including some biographical or demographic details.</li>
<li><strong>Comprehensive Questions</strong>: Questions need careful consideration to ensure comprehensiveness.</li>
<li><strong>Appropriate Length</strong>: The questionnaire should maintain an appropriate length.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: While these considerations focus on content, they do not address the questionnaire's appearance, functionality, and layout, including aspects like typography, graphics, instructions, and spacing.</p>
<h4 id="questionnaire-administration" tabindex="-1">Questionnaire Administration</h4>
<p>Questionnaires, often used for large-scale data collection, can be administered through various means, including pen and paper, web-based platforms, or telephone interviews. The diagram below illustrates the diverse methods through which questionnaires (sometimes referred to as surveys) are conducted.</p>

<h3 id="biophysiological-measures-in-healthcare-research" tabindex="-1">Biophysiological Measures in Healthcare Research</h3>
<p>Healthcare professionals routinely measure biophysiological physical variables, necessitating specialized technical instruments and equipment. These measures can be broadly classified into two types: in vivo measures conducted directly within or on living organisms, and in vitro measures performed outside the body using materials extracted from it (e.g., serum potassium levels). Nursing researchers frequently employ biophysiological measures in their studies, covering various domains:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Circulatory Function</strong>: Heart rate, arterial blood pressure</li>
<li><strong>Respiratory Function</strong>: Respiratory rate, tidal volume, alveolar ventilation</li>
<li><strong>Neurological Function</strong>: Peripheral skin temperature</li>
<li><strong>Blood Tests</strong>: Blood gas analysis, blood pH</li>
<li><strong>Urine Tests</strong>: Urinary cortisol level</li>
<li><strong>Umbilical Cord Culture</strong>: Bacterial colonization rates, Staphylococcus aureus, and Group B Streptococcus</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="biophysiological-measures-as-data-collection%3A" tabindex="-1">Biophysiological Measures as Data Collection:</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Objective</strong>: The equipment used and the individuals interpreting results are likely to be consistent, ensuring objectivity.</li>
<li><strong>Accuracy, Precision, and Sensitivity</strong>: Biophysiological measures are relatively accurate, precise, and sensitive in capturing subtle changes.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Distorted Measurements</strong>: There is a low likelihood of deliberately distorted measurements, enhancing the reliability of the collected data.</li>
<li><strong>Validity</strong>: The instruments employed provide targeted measurements aligned with the study variables, ensuring validity.</li>
<li><strong>Economic Efficiency</strong>: Utilizing biophysiological measures for data collection is economical. When the required equipment and expertise are readily available in a hospital setting, the cost of data collection is reduced.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, leveraging biophysiological measures in healthcare research not only ensures the objectivity, accuracy, and validity of data but also proves to be a cost-effective and efficient approach when conducted within a hospital environment with existing expertise and equipment.</p>
<h3 id="interviews" tabindex="-1">Interviews</h3>
<p>Interviews are a well-established data collection technique and probably the most commonly used data collection method in healthcare research.
Individual interviews are frequently used in healthcare settings to investigate patients' opinions and experiences regarding the provision, delivery, and calibre of care, as well as to solicit suggestions for improvement.</p>
<p>Interviews can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Structured</li>
<li>Unstructured</li>
<li>Semi-structured</li>
</ul>
<p>Structured interviews are commonly used in market research and the aim is to ask all the respondents the same questions uniformly. The wording is planned in advance and each question is asked in the same order and in the same manner. Interviewers are trained to adhere to a protocol. Interviews carried out in this manner are very similar to questionnaires but the problem of poor response rate is significantly reduced as the data is being collected directly at the time.</p>
<p>The problems with this type of interview are that respondents can’t give sophisticated answers or indeed any answer that is not given in the interview schedule. There is a lack of opportunity for free expression and this means some relevant issues may not be covered.</p>
<h4 id="key-points-to-remember-when-interviewing-a-participant-(interview-tips)" tabindex="-1">Key points to remember when Interviewing a participant (Interview Tips)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Plan your interview</li>
<li>Explain the interview process</li>
<li>Ask open-ended questions</li>
<li>Avoid leading questions</li>
<li>Avoid long questions</li>
<li>Early questions should be easy to answer</li>
<li>Be active listener</li>
<li>Avoid using complex medical terminology or technical jargon or ambigious terms</li>
<li>Prepare an interview guide (See Figure)</li>
<li>Share interview guide if necessary - it prepares participants for the interview</li>
<li>Add as you want</li>
<li>Audio/Video Record the interview (with permission) - Recording frees you up to concentrate on your interview and also enhances validity and reliability of data collection.</li>
<li>Confirm time, date and location of interview in advance -</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="interview-guide" tabindex="-1">Interview guide</h4>
<p>An interview guide is essentially a structured interview schedule that consists of a limited set of questions accompanied by follow-up prompts to facilitate additional discussion. While developing an interview guide, it is advisable to research the topic in detail and consult with others who have knowledge of the research area. It does not mean involving researchers, often services users and carers are expert in the area and can help develop the interview questions. It is also essential to pilot the interview guide in order to test the questions and obtain some interviewing experience. Keep your interview guide flexible, so that there is a space for participants to bring diverse perspectives into the interview.</p>

In the realm of qualitative research, a Focus Group Discussion (FGD) stands as a dynamic and engaging method, facilitating in-depth conversations among a small, diverse group of participants. Imagine it as a face-to-face interview, orchestrated by a skilled moderator or facilitator, bringing together individuals to delve into their perceptions, perspectives, and opinions about a specific topic. This carefully planned discussion unfolds in a non-threatening and supportive environment, fostering open dialogue and sharing.
<p>Originally crafted for marketing research, the utility of FGDs extends across various domains, including business management, social sciences, and healthcare research. This method transcends the traditional interview format, fostering a collective and shared exploration of social meanings. It is a living interaction, providing an open platform for individuals to express criticism, share negative views, or discuss sensitive topics like domestic violence.
In crafting a Focus Group, the selection of participants is strategic. For discussions on sensitive topics, such as domestic violence, homogenous groups are preferred, where participants share a specific demographic characteristic like race or ethnicity. This homogeneity creates a comfortable and safe space for participants to candidly share their true opinions and experiences.</p>
<p>Typically, a well-orchestrated FGD involves seven to ten participants. Managing a group with more than ten can be challenging, while a group with fewer than seven may not yield the depth and richness desired in the discussion. The session usually spans between 1 and 2 hours, allowing sufficient time for exploration and meaningful dialogue.
In essence, a Focus Group Discussion is not just a method; it's an orchestrated conversation that unveils collective insights, encourages open expression, and enriches the understanding of complex phenomena. Whether you're exploring consumer preferences, organizational dynamics, or sensitive social issues, FGDs offer a unique window into the diverse tapestry of human perspectives.</p>
